    <!--Game Programming Description-->
    <h2>Game Programming at UAT</h2>
    <p>
        Courses in Game Programming will emphasize the essential issues and the skills required to develop games for multiple video 
        game platforms such as PC, consoles, mobile, online and virtual reality. These skills have broader applications in related 
        industries such as entertainment, business, research, and training. Game Programming students begin with the programming 
        principles, skills, and techniques shared in all programming disciplines and then focus on game-specific features and 
        techniques. This program emphasizes C++ programming, C# programming, scripting, data handling, gameplay interaction, 
        artificial intelligence, networking and the use of industry-standard middleware, game engines, and APIs. Students in Game 
        Programming will also develop a critical approach to the study of gameplay, interaction, and design.
